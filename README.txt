This is our final project for CSC 325 Database Management class. The goal is to use everything we learned in the class and apply to the final project.

Muddy Wheels is a simple travel application that allows users to book a flight or rent a car. 
The language used is Java, and the program is text-based.

The IDE used was Codio Virtual Machine, configured by professor Bob Dugan. So, these are all the files we used, they are not perfect, but working. And I'm not sure if they will run on other IDEs other than COdio Virtual Machine.

Run this command in Terminal to run the Main Program: sh compilerun.sh

For future: we didn't have enough time to create a GUI to the project, so it's text based and not pretty now. Future goal is to make it graphic display, and clean up the code by pulling everythings from Database as much as possible instead of hard code some options.

Authors? Alvin, Sean, Ula.
Spring 2024.
